# Info

This is a collection of math programs I made in Python.

## Dataset Graph.py

This script takes txt files as input, then performs baseline correction and normalization. You can also shift spectras up or down to allow stacking. I created this for Raman spectra but it can be used with any spectroscopy data. Ensure that the normalization and baseline methods are compatible with your specific needs.

## Integrate.py

This script will integrate functions, and then use the fundamental theorem of calculus to solve for the area under its curve. It will also average the integral and root it, giving you the RMS, useful for evaluating AC circuits.

## Variance.py

Super simple variance calculator. If you're a student, just use Excel.
